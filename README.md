# Surfs_Up
Climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database has been done on Jupyter Notebook using Python and SQLAlchemy.

Also included an Flask API Application to query:
* Precipitations from last year
* Weather stations
* Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year
* Minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start and/or start-end range inlcusive.

Paired t-test has been done on the temperature of June and December with an alpha of 0.05. The the p-value is less than 0.05, we rejected the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the means of June and December temperature and concluded that a significant difference does exist.
